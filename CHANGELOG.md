# 3.0.1 (beta)

* [BREAKING] Daemon executable directory moved from
             `/Library/Application Support/LinkDaemon`
             to
             `/Library/Application Support/io.github.halo.linkdaemon`
             as this is more future-proof.

             as this is more future-proof and I think the way Apple wants it.
